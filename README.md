# Exploring Machine Learning with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 

As a Computer Science student, Iâ€™ve started diving into the world of Machine Learning, and this week I completed a hands-on mini project using the famous Iris Dataset.

This project implements the KNN algorithm (K=6) using Scikit-learn, covering:
- Data exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Dataset
- Iris Dataset (available in Scikit-learn)
